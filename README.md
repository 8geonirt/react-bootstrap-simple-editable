Welcome to my little project, I had the necessity to create something like this because of a project I am helping to build, the design required to implement something complex, I started looking at some libraries and found a really good ones, unfortunately those did not give me the enough functionality to customize them and to adapt them to what I need.

I got inspired on those libraries to build my own, and so far this is what I've built with this one.
![advancedexample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2782816/81238955-0b5c0580-8fc9-11ea-90f4-51a5f6a7293c.gif)

There are a lot of libraries like this around there, I am going to mention the ones that inspired me to build this one. [https://github.com/ni3galave/react-x-editable](https://github.com/ni3galave/react-x-editable) and [https://github.com/kunyan/react-bootstrap-xeditable](https://github.com/kunyan/react-bootstrap-xeditable)...
I really like them, they are great but those are not what I needed, so here I am learning and trying to do some give back.

And I don't want to forget about this one: I am using the library **React Hook Form** which you can find it [here](https://react-hook-form.com/), you can take a look at it to see how powerful it is regarding to validations, and BTW, the performance is really good (check the comparison with other libraries as well).  I would like to add more features like passing custom validations using patterns by taking advantage of this React Hook Form library, so if you want to contribute with it (or something else) feel free to do it.

I wanted to share this to any developer who wants or needs to build something like in the recording above.
Hope you find it useful, it's my first library published to NPM and any feedback is always welcome.
